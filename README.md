This repository contains some example code from https://github.com/OSEHRA/VistA-M/blob/master/Packages/Dental/Routines/DENTA1.m

It is a MUMPS project from the 1960s, reproduced here for your entertainment.

If you are ever sad because the code you work on is unreadable, just be glad you don't have to work on this code. A lot of code from that era looked like this, actually.

And if you do have to work on code like this, do your best.
